# AI Tools in Education Project

### Abstract

This project focuses on integrating artificial intelligence into K-12 science education. It addresses two primary objectives: first, the development of custom AI prompts to serve as interactive learning assistants for science concepts; and second, the creation of AI-scaffolded materials to support English Language Learners (ELLs). The aim is to demonstrate how these tools can enhance personalized learning and improve academic accessibility for diverse student populations, drawing from my experience as a high school science teacher.

### Repository Structure

- `/prompts`: Contains files with examples of custom prompts.
- `/data`: Holds sample data sets for ELL support tools.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for parsing and processing project data.

### ðŸ’¡ Custom Prompt Library

This project includes a curated library of custom prompts designed for specific educational challenges in the high school science classroom, particularly Chemistry and ELL support.

| **Prompt Title** | **Focus Area** | **Description** | **Link** | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Socratic Chemistry Tutor** | Stoichiometry | Guides students through complex calculations step-by-step using only guiding questions. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/socratic_chemistry_tutor.md) | 
| **ELL Text Simplifier** | Vocabulary / Reading | Takes a dense scientific paragraph and outputs a simplified version with a target vocabulary list. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/ell_text_simplifier.md) | 
| **Reaction Mechanism Explainer** | Organic Chemistry | Acts as a visual aid describer, explaining reaction steps in accessible language. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/reaction_mechanism.md) | 
| **Balancing Equation Scaffolder** | General Chemistry | Breaks down the steps for balancing complex equations, asking the user to confirm each step. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/balancing_scaffolder.md) |

### Usage Information

For best results, copy the full "Prompt Text" from the linked Markdown file and paste it into your preferred large language model (LLM), such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.

**1. Copy the Prompt**

**2. Paste into LLM**

The core of the system instruction is usually at the top of the prompt text.
